Threshold value calculation:

We check if the largest 'no_match' value is smaller than or equal to the smallest 'partial_match' or 'exact_match' value. If so, it calculates the threshold as the midpoint. If not, it still calculates a midpoint but labels it as a "Suggested" threshold due to overlap.
